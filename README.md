# Research_Project
Had a really fun time with this project. Got signed on as a paid RA and had to make this program that pulls all the financial times articles from 2014-2020. Program allows you to grab any number of articles from any publisher over any timeframe on the database, can stop and start without losing your place in the data pull. Pulled around half a million articles.

For parse.pyx, I was given two lists with a total of around 100,000 companies and was tasked with filtering the articles so that only companies with names in the list were left in the dataset. Originally, I wasn't planning on cythonizing the program but after estimating how long regular Python would take to parse through all the articles, I decided the Cython route would be better. The cleanup.pyx file is meant to further filter some of the results from the first parse.
